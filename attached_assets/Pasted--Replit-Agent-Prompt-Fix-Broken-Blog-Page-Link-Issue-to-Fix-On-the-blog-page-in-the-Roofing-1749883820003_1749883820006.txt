# Replit Agent Prompt: Fix Broken Blog Page Link

## Issue to Fix:
On the blog page, in the "Roofing Blog" section, the "learn roof maintenance tips" clickable link/button currently goes to an empty page and needs to be fixed.

## Solution:
Link the "learn roof maintenance tips" button to the same destination as the "maintenance tips" button in the footer - the comprehensive 30 maintenance tips page we just created.

## Specific Instructions:

### 1. Locate the Problem:
- Navigate to the blog page
- Find the "Roofing Blog" section 
- Locate the "learn roof maintenance tips" clickable element

### 2. Fix the Link:
- Update the href attribute to point to the same URL as the footer "maintenance tips" button
- Ensure the link opens in the same tab (not a new window) for better user experience
- Test that the link works properly after the fix

### 3. Verify Consistency:
- Confirm both links (blog page and footer) now go to the same maintenance tips page
- Check that the maintenance tips page loads properly from both locations
- Ensure no 404 errors or broken redirects

### 4. Optional Improvements (if time permits):
- Consider updating the button text to be more specific: "View Our 30 Essential Maintenance Tips"
- Ensure the button styling matches other CTAs on the blog page
- Add hover effects if not already present

### 5. Test the Fix:
