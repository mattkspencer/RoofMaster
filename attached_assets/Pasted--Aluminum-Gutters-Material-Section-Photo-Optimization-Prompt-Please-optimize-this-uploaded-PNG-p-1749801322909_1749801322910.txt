# Aluminum Gutters Material Section Photo Optimization Prompt

**Please optimize this uploaded PNG photo for use on my Gutter Services page. Here's what I need you to do:**

## 1. Image Processing:
* Optimize the PNG image for web performance while maintaining high quality (aim for under 400KB)
* Convert to WebP format as well for better compression
* Resize to optimal dimensions for the gutter materials section (recommend 800x600 or 900x675 for 4:3 ratio)
* Preserve the original color saturation, brightness, and natural lighting - NO color corrections or brightness adjustments

## 2. File Management:
* Save the optimized images to: `client/public/images/gutter-services/`
* Name appropriately like `aluminum-gutters-material.webp` and `aluminum-gutters-material.png`
* Create responsive versions (thumbnail/medium/full) for different viewing contexts

## 3. Implementation:
* Locate my "Gutter Services" page
* **SPECIFICALLY:** Find the "Gutter Materials Options" section
* **LOCATE:** The aluminum area/subsection within the materials options
* **REPLACE:** The placeholder image in the aluminum gutters area
* Insert the new optimized image in its place
* Add proper alt text like 'Professional aluminum gutter installation and materials'
* Ensure consistent sizing with other gutter materials option images

## 4. Performance & Quality:
* Implement WebP format with PNG fallback for browser compatibility
* Add responsive srcset for optimal loading across devices
* Maintain fast loading performance within the gutter services layout
* Keep the image looking exactly like the original PNG upload - just web-optimized
* Ensure proper aspect ratio consistency with other material option images

## 5. Materials Section Integration:
* Ensure the image showcases aluminum gutters effectively
* Position appropriately within the aluminum materials subsection
* Maintain professional appearance consistent with other material option images
* Complement the aluminum gutter information and specifications

**Please locate the "Gutter Materials Options" section on the Gutter Services page, find the aluminum area, and replace the placeholder image with this optimized PNG image while maintaining the professional materials selection layout.**
