# Fix Website Consistency Issues Across All Pages

I have several styling and consistency problems across different pages of my website that need to be fixed:

## Critical Issues to Fix:

### 1. **Submit Request Button (Home Page Contact Form)**
- The "Submit Request" button in the contact form has lost its proper styling
- It should be a prominent blue button that matches all other buttons on the site
- Ensure it has proper contrast, hover effects, and consistent styling with other call-to-action buttons

### 2. **Footer Inconsistency Across Pages**
The footer styling varies between pages and needs to be standardized:
- **Home Page**: Footer looks correct (use this as the template)
- **About Page**: Minor spacing/alignment differences from home page
- **Portfolio Page**: Slight variations in layout
- **Blog Page**: **MAJOR ISSUES** - Footer is severely broken, asymmetrical, and has poor spacing

### 3. **Footer Layout Problems (Especially Blog Page)**
- Footer content is not properly aligned
- Spacing between footer sections is inconsistent
- Some pages have asymmetrical footer layouts
- Footer links and text positioning varies between pages

## Required Fixes:

1. **Standardize Footer Design**: Use the HOME PAGE footer as the master template and apply identical styling to ALL pages:
   - Same dark navy background color (current color is perfect)
   - Same white text color (current color is perfect) 
   - Same spacing, padding, and margins
   - Same column layout and alignment
   - Same social media icon styling

2. **Fix Form Button Styling**: Restore the submit button to match other blue buttons with proper contrast and hover effects

3. **Ensure Cross-Page Consistency**: All pages should have identical footer appearance, spacing, and functionality

## Pages to Fix:
- Home Page: Fix submit button only (footer is correct)
- About Page: Standardize footer to match home page
- Portfolio Page: Standardize footer to match home page  
- Blog Page: **Priority fix** - completely rebuild footer to match home page template

The current footer color scheme (dark navy with white text) is excellent - just make it consistent across all pages and fix the broken layouts, especially on the blog page.
