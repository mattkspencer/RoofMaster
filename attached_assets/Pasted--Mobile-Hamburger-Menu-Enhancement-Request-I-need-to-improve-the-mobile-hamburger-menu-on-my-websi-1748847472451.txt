# Mobile Hamburger Menu Enhancement Request

I need to improve the mobile hamburger menu on my website. Currently, the services dropdown items are too cramped and create a poor user experience on mobile devices.

## Current Structure:
- Home
- About  
- Services (dropdown with: Residential Roofing, Commercial Roofing, Roof Repairs, Insurance Claims, Gutter Services)
- Portfolio
- Blog

## Issues to Fix:
1. Services dropdown items are lumped too close together on mobile
2. Difficult to tap individual service options accurately
3. Poor spacing and readability on small screens

## Requirements for Mobile Menu:
1. **Better Spacing**: Add proper padding and margins between all menu items, especially service dropdown options
2. **Touch-Friendly Design**: Make all clickable areas at least 44px tall for easy finger tapping
3. **Clear Visual Separation**: Add subtle borders or dividers between service categories
4. **Smooth Animation**: Implement smooth expand/collapse animation for the services dropdown
5. **Improved Typography**: Ensure text is readable with appropriate font sizes for mobile
6. **Proper Hierarchy**: Main menu items should be visually distinct from sub-menu items
7. **Easy Navigation**: Clear back/close functionality

## Specific Mobile Enhancements Needed:
- Increase vertical spacing between service options to at least 12-16px
- Add left indentation for service sub-items to show hierarchy
- Implement proper touch targets (minimum 44px height)
- Add hover/active states that work well on touch devices
- Ensure the hamburger menu closes when a service is selected
- Make the services dropdown toggleable (tap to open/close)

## Technical Preferences:
- Use CSS flexbox or grid for consistent spacing
- Implement smooth CSS transitions
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Keep code clean and maintainable
- Use semantic HTML structure

Please provide the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code needed to create a professional, user-friendly mobile hamburger menu that addresses these spacing and usability issues.
