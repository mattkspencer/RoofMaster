Please optimize this uploaded PNG photo for use on my Gutter Services page. Here's what I need you to do:

Image Processing:

Optimize the PNG image for web performance while maintaining high quality (aim for under 400KB)
Convert to WebP format as well for better compression
Resize to optimal dimensions for the gutter materials section (recommend 800x600 or 900x675 for 4:3 ratio)
Preserve the original color saturation, brightness, and natural lighting - NO color corrections or brightness adjustments


File Management:

Save the optimized images to: client/public/images/gutter-services/
Name appropriately like copper-gutters-material.webp and copper-gutters-material.png
Create responsive versions (thumbnail/medium/full) for different viewing contexts


Implementation:

Locate my "Gutter Services" page
SPECIFICALLY: Find the "Gutter Materials Options" section
LOCATE: The copper area/subsection within the materials options
REPLACE: The placeholder image in the copper gutters area
Insert the new optimized image in its place
Add proper alt text like 'Professional copper gutter installation and materials'
Ensure consistent sizing with other gutter materials option images (match aluminum, steel, and other material images)


Performance & Quality:

Implement WebP format with PNG fallback for browser compatibility
Add responsive srcset for optimal loading across devices
Maintain fast loading performance within the gutter services layout
Keep the image looking exactly like the original PNG upload - just web-optimized
Ensure proper aspect ratio consistency with aluminum, steel, and other material option images


Materials Section Integration:

Ensure the image showcases copper gutters effectively
Position appropriately within the copper materials subsection
Maintain professional appearance consistent with aluminum, steel, and other material option images
Complement the copper gutter information and specifications
Ensure visual consistency across all material options (aluminum, steel, copper, etc.)



Please locate the "Gutter Materials Options" section on the Gutter Services page, find the copper area/subsection, and replace the placeholder image with this optimized PNG image while maintaining the professional materials selection layout and consistency with the aluminum and steel gutters images.
