Please optimize this uploaded PNG photo for use on my Commercial Roofing page. Here's what I need you to do:

Image Processing:

Optimize the PNG image for web performance while maintaining high quality (aim for under 400KB)
Convert to WebP format as well for better compression
Resize to optimal dimensions for the commercial roofing services section (recommend 800x600 or 900x675 for 4:3 ratio)
Preserve the original color saturation, brightness, and natural lighting - NO color corrections or brightness adjustments


File Management:

Save the optimized images to: client/public/images/commercial-roofing/
Name appropriately like new-roof-installation.webp and new-roof-installation.png
Create responsive versions (thumbnail/medium/full) for different viewing contexts


Implementation:

Locate my "Commercial Roofing" page
SPECIFICALLY: Find the "Our Commercial Roofing Services" section
LOCATE: The "New Roof Installation" subsection within the services
REPLACE: The placeholder image in the new roof installation area
Insert the new optimized image in its place
Add proper alt text like 'Professional new commercial roof installation services'
Ensure consistent sizing with other commercial roofing service images


Performance & Quality:

Implement WebP format with PNG fallback for browser compatibility
Add responsive srcset for optimal loading across devices
Maintain fast loading performance within the commercial roofing services layout
Keep the image looking exactly like the original PNG upload - just web-optimized
Ensure proper aspect ratio consistency with other service option images


Services Section Integration:

Ensure the image showcases new roof installation effectively
Position appropriately within the new roof installation subsection
Maintain professional appearance consistent with other commercial roofing service images
Complement the new roof installation information and specifications
Ensure visual consistency across all service options



Please locate the "Our Commercial Roofing Services" section on the Commercial Roofing page, find the "New Roof Installation" subsection, and replace the placeholder image with this optimized PNG image while maintaining the professional services layout and consistency with other commercial roofing service images.
