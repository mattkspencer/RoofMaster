# Fix Portfolio 404 Error & Create Professional Project Details Page

## Current Issue
My Spencer Roofing Solutions website has a broken "View Project Details" link in the portfolio section under "Asphalt Shingle Roof Replacement" that leads to a 404 error.

## Task Requirements

### Step 1: Analyze Current Website Structure
1. First, examine my existing file structure and code organization
2. Identify how the current website is built (single page, multiple pages, framework used)
3. Locate the portfolio section and find the broken "Asphalt Shingle Roof Replacement" project link
4. Determine the best file structure approach based on my existing setup

### Step 2: Fix the Broken Portfolio Link
1. Update the "View Project Details" link to work with the chosen file structure
2. Use a path that makes sense with my current organization (could be `/projects/`, `/portfolio/`, or another structure)

### Step 3: Create Project Directory & File Structure
1. Based on the analysis, create the appropriate folder structure (e.g., `projects`, `portfolio`, or within existing structure)
2. Create the new project details file using a naming convention that fits my site

### Step 6: Testing Requirements
