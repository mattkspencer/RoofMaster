IMPORTANT: Do NOT replace my existing roofing assistant. Only make targeted improvements to what's already working.
I want to enhance my current roofing assistant with these specific improvements:
1. Emergency Detection & Response

Add keyword detection for emergencies: "leak", "water damage", "emergency", "urgent", "storm damage", "tree fell"
When emergency keywords detected, show prominent message: "ðŸš¨ This sounds urgent! Call us immediately at (720) 360-8546 for emergency service."
Add a red "Call Now" button that opens phone dialer

2. Colorado-Specific Knowledge
Add responses for these common Colorado roofing issues:

Hail damage: Mention Colorado's severe hail season (April-July), insurance claims process
Wind damage: Reference Colorado's high winds, missing shingles
Snow load: Winter roof concerns, ice dams
UV damage: High altitude sun exposure effects

3. Better Response Options
Instead of generic responses, provide specific options like:

"Schedule Free Roof Inspection"
"Learn About Insurance Claims"
"Get Emergency Repair Service"
"View Our Recent Projects"

4. Simple Lead Capture
When someone shows interest in scheduling, ask for:

Their address (for service area verification)
Best phone number
Preferred time (this week/next week/flexible)

5. Common Problem Responses
Add smart responses for:

"How much does a roof cost?" â†’ Provide Colorado pricing ranges
"Do you work with insurance?" â†’ Explain claims process
"How long does installation take?" â†’ Give realistic timelines
"What materials do you recommend?" â†’ Colorado-appropriate options

Implementation Requirements:

Keep all existing functionality that's currently working
Only add these enhancements, don't rewrite the entire system
Test each feature as you add it
Make changes incrementally, not all at once
Preserve the current chat interface and styling

Success Criteria:

Emergency detection works reliably
Colorado-specific information appears when relevant
Lead capture flow is smooth and natural
All existing features still work exactly as before

Please implement these improvements one at a time, testing each before moving to the next. Start with emergency detection since that's most critical for a roofing business.
