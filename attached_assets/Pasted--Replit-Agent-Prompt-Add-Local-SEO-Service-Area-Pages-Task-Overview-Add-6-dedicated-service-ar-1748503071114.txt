# Replit Agent Prompt: Add Local SEO Service Area Pages

## Task Overview
Add 6 dedicated service area pages to my React roofing website to improve local SEO rankings for Denver metro area searches. Each page should be optimized for local keywords and include location-specific content.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Create React Components and Routes
- Add 6 new React page components in `/src/pages/` or `/src/components/pages/`:
  - `EnglewoodRoofing.jsx`
  - `DenverRoofing.jsx` 
  - `AuroraRoofing.jsx`
  - `LittletonRoofing.jsx`
  - `ArvadaRoofing.jsx`
  - `CastleRockRoofing.jsx`

### 2. Update React Router Configuration
- Add new routes to your main routing file (likely `App.jsx` or `router.jsx`):
  - `/englewood-roofing-services`
  - `/denver-roofing-contractor`
  - `/aurora-roofing-company`
  - `/littleton-roof-replacement`
  - `/arvada-roof-repair`
  - `/castle-rock-roofing-services`

### 3. Page Structure Template
Each page should include these sections:
- **Hero Section**: Location-specific headline with primary keyword
- **Services Section**: List of services offered in that area
- **Local Information**: Area-specific details (weather patterns, common roofing issues)
- **Service Areas**: Neighborhoods within that city we serve
- **Call-to-Action**: Contact form with location pre-filled
- **Schema Markup**: LocalBusiness structured data for SEO

### 4. SEO Optimization Requirements
- **Title Tags**: "[City] Roofing Services | Licensed Roofer | Spencer Roofing"
- **Meta Descriptions**: Include city name, main service, and call-to-action (150-160 chars)
- **H1 Tags**: Primary keyword as H1 (e.g., "Englewood Roofing Services")
- **H2/H3 Tags**: Secondary keywords and service variations
- **Internal Linking**: Link to main services pages and other location pages
- **Image Alt Tags**: Include location in alt text for images

## Content Guidelines

### Primary Keywords for Each City:
- **Englewood**: "Englewood roofing services", "roofer Englewood CO"
- **Denver**: "Denver roofing contractor", "roof repair Denver"
- **Aurora**: "Aurora roofing company", "roof replacement Aurora CO"
- **Littleton**: "Littleton roof replacement", "roofer Littleton Colorado"
- **Arvada**: "Arvada roof repair", "roofing company Arvada"
- **Castle Rock**: "Castle Rock roofing services", "roofer Castle Rock CO"

### Content Elements to Include:
1. **Local Weather Considerations**: Mention Colorado hail, snow loads, wind damage
2. **Neighborhood Names**: Include 3-5 specific neighborhoods per city
3. **Local Landmarks**: Reference well-known local features
4. **Service Distance**: "Serving [City] and surrounding areas within 25 miles"
