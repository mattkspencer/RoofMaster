Redesign the existing contact form component to reduce friction and increase conversions by implementing a progressive disclosure approach. Create two form options:
OPTION 1: Quick Quote Form (Primary/Default)

Only 3 required fields with asterisks:

Name* (required)
Phone* (required)
Service Type* (required - dropdown with options like 'Emergency Repair', 'Insurance Claim', 'New Installation', 'Free Inspection')


Optional fields (no asterisks, lighter styling):

Email (optional - but incentivize with 'Get project updates via email')
Address (optional - with placeholder 'Property address for accurate estimate')
Message (optional - placeholder: 'Brief description of your needs')



OPTION 2: Detailed Form (Secondary)

Add a small link below Quick Quote: 'Need to provide more details? Use detailed form'
Include all your current fields but make only Name, Phone, Service required
Move 'How did you hear about us?' to optional section

Key Changes:

Remove asterisks from: Email, Address, Message, 'How did you hear about us'
Change required field styling: Make asterisks smaller and less prominent, use subtle red color instead of bright red
Add progress indicators: Show 'Step 1 of 1' for Quick Quote to emphasize simplicity
Improve CTA button: Change from 'Submit' to 'Get My Free Quote' or 'Schedule My Inspection'
Add trust signals: Small text under form: 'No obligation • Licensed & Insured • Response within 2 hours'
Smart defaults: Pre-select 'Free Inspection' as default service type
Mobile optimization: Larger touch targets, simplified keyboard types (tel for phone, email for email)

Form Validation Updates:

Keep your existing backend validation but only enforce Name, Phone, Service as required
Update error messages to be friendlier: 'We need your phone number to schedule your inspection' instead of 'Phone is required'
Add real-time validation (green checkmarks as fields are completed correctly)

Visual Hierarchy:

Make the Quick Quote form prominent with larger text and more visual weight
Style optional fields with lighter borders and smaller labels
Use progressive disclosure - show optional fields in a collapsed 'Additional Details' section

This approach reduces the initial commitment from 7 required fields to just 3, while still capturing the essential information needed for follow-up. The optional fields can capture additional details from motivated prospects without creating barriers for quick inquiries."
