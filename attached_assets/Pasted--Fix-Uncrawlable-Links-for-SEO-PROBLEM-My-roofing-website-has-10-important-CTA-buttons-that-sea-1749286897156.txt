# Fix Uncrawlable Links for SEO

## PROBLEM
My roofing website has 10 important CTA buttons that search engines cannot crawl because they lack proper `href` attributes. These buttons currently use JavaScript/onClick handlers but are invisible to search engines.

## TASK
Convert JavaScript-only buttons to proper anchor tags with `href` attributes so search engines can crawl and follow these important links.

## SPECIFIC BUTTONS TO FIX

### High-Priority CTA Buttons:
1. **"Schedule a Consultation"** - Should link to contact form or scheduling page
2. **"Get Your Free Consultation"** - Should link to contact form
3. **"Discuss Your Project"** - Should link to contact form
4. **"Schedule a Free Inspection"** - Should link to contact form or scheduling

### Service Page Buttons:
5. **"View Project Details"** (appears multiple times) - Should link to portfolio/projects page

### Blog Navigation:
6. **"Read More"** buttons in blog section - Should link to individual blog posts
7. **"View All Articles"** - Should link to blog index page

## REQUIREMENTS
1. Find all buttons/links that currently have CSS classes but no `href` attributes
2. Add proper `href` attributes pointing to relevant pages
3. Keep existing styling and hover effects
4. Maintain any existing JavaScript functionality (onClick handlers)
5. Use relative URLs where possible (e.g., `/contact`, `/services`, `/blog`)

## EXAMPLE CONVERSION
**Before:**
```jsx
<a class="inline-block bg-primary hover:bg-primary-dark text-white font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg">
  Schedule a Consultation
</a>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<a href="/contact" class="inline-block bg-primary hover:bg-primary-dark text-white font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-lg">
  Schedule a Consultation
</a>
```

## SUGGESTED LINK DESTINATIONS
- Contact/Consultation buttons → `/contact` or `/#contact`
- Service details → `/services` or specific service pages
- Blog "Read More" → individual blog post URLs
- "View All Articles" → `/blog`
- Project details → `/portfolio` or `/projects`

## CONTEXT
This is a React-based Spencer Roofing Solutions website. These CTA buttons are critical for lead generation, and making them crawlable will help search engines understand the site structure and improve SEO rankings.
